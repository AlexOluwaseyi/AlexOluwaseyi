I am a full-stack Software Engineer with a strong focus on backend development. With a first degree in Electronics and Electrical Engineering, my background provides a robust foundation in both hardware and software disciplines. I am eager to explore and contribute to the evolving fields of Software Engineering, Human-Robotics Interaction (HRI), and Computer Engineering.

To prepare for these exciting opportunities, I have completed courses in programming and software engineering, which have deepened my expertise and equipped me with the skills necessary to navigate the future of technology.
